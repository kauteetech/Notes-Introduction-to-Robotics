                    {
                        question: "In robotics, what does DOF stand for?",
                        answer: "B",
                        explanation: "DOF stands for Degrees of Freedom, which represents the number of independent parameters needed to specify the configuration of a system. For robots, it typically refers to the number of independent joint motions possible."
                    },
                    {
                        question: "What is the workspace of a robot manipulator?",
                        answer: "B",
                        explanation: "The workspace is the set of all points in space that can be reached by the robot's end-effector. It's determined by the robot's kinematic structure, joint limits, and link lengths, and is crucial for task planning and robot selection."
                    },
                    {
                        question: "What is the primary purpose of inverse kinematics in robotics?",
                        answer: "B",
                        explanation: "Inverse kinematics solves for the joint angles required to position the robot's end-effector at a desired location and orientation. This is fundamental for robot motion planning and control, converting Cartesian space commands to joint space commands."
                    },
                    {
                        question: "What is the difference between forward and inverse kinematics?",
                        answer: "B",
                        explanation: "Forward kinematics computes end-effector position and orientation from given joint angles. Inverse kinematics solves for joint angles needed to achieve a desired end-effector pose. Inverse kinematics is generally more complex and may have multiple solutions."
                    },
                    {
                        question: "What is the Jacobian matrix in robotics?",
                        answer: "B",
                        explanation: "The Jacobian matrix J(q) linearly relates joint velocities qÃá to end-effector velocity: ·∫ã = J(q)qÃá. It's fundamental for velocity control, force analysis, and singularity analysis. The Jacobian depends on the current configuration q."
                    },
                    {
                        question: "What is the Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) convention used for?",
                        answer: "B",
                        explanation: "The DH convention provides a systematic method for assigning coordinate frames to joints in serial manipulators and deriving forward kinematics. It uses four parameters per joint (a, Œ±, d, Œ∏) to completely specify the kinematic structure."
                    },
                    {
                        question: "What is a kinematic singularity in robotics?",
                        answer: "B",
                        explanation: "A kinematic singularity occurs when the robot loses one or more degrees of freedom due to specific joint configurations. At singularities, the Jacobian matrix becomes rank-deficient, causing loss of controllability in certain directions."
                    },
                    {
                        question: "What is workspace analysis in robotics?",
                        answer: "B",
                        explanation: "Workspace analysis determines the set of all positions and orientations reachable by the robot's end-effector. This includes both the reachable workspace (positions only) and the dexterous workspace (positions with full orientation capability)."

                        explanation: "The Euler-Lagrangian framework uses the Lagrangian L = T - V (kinetic minus potential energy) to systematically derive equations of motion for mechanical systems. The Euler-Lagrange equation d/dt(‚àÇL/‚àÇqÃá) - ‚àÇL/‚àÇq = œÑ provides a principled way to obtain the governing differential equations."

                        explanation: "G(q) represents the gravitational forces and torques acting on the system as a function of configuration q. These terms arise from potential energy and must be compensated or exploited depending on the control strategy."

                        answer: "B",
                        explanation: "This form represents the dynamics of multi-link mechanical systems including robot manipulators. M(q) is the inertia matrix, C(q,qÃá) captures Coriolis/centripetal effects, G(q) represents gravity, and œÑ are the applied torques or forces."

                        answer: "B",
                        explanation: "The inertia matrix M(q) is always symmetric (Mij = Mji) due to the physics of rotational inertia, and positive definite because kinetic energy T = ¬ΩqÃá·µÄM(q)qÃá is always positive for non-zero velocities. This ensures the matrix is invertible."

                        explanation: "Christoffel symbols arise from the differentiation of the kinetic energy expression and define the elements of the Coriolis/centripetal matrix C(q,qÃá). They capture how kinetic energy changes with configuration and velocity."

                        explanation: "The important property is that ·πÄ(q) - 2C(q,qÃá) is skew-symmetric, which is crucial for energy-based analysis and passivity-based control design. This property ensures energy conservation in the absence of external forces and dissipation."

                        answer: "B",
                        explanation: "B is the input matrix that maps the control torques u to the generalized coordinates. For a double pendulum with actuators at both joints, B = I (identity matrix). The structure of B determines which degrees of freedom are directly actuated."

                        explanation: "Fully-actuated systems have enough actuators to independently control all degrees of freedom, while underactuated systems have fewer actuators than degrees of freedom. This fundamental difference affects control strategies, as underactuated systems cannot follow arbitrary trajectories and must exploit natural dynamics for control."

                        answer: "B",
                        explanation: "Underactuation occurs when rank[f‚ÇÇ(q,qÃá,t)] < dim(q), meaning the control input matrix f‚ÇÇ doesn't have full rank. This indicates there are fewer independent control directions than state dimensions, making the system unable to accelerate in arbitrary directions in the configuration space."

                        explanation: "Walking robots are typically underactuated because they have fewer actuators than the total degrees of freedom of the system including the floating base. The robot cannot directly control its position in space but must use ground contact forces and internal joint motions to achieve desired motions."

                        explanation: "The key challenge is exploiting the state-dependent coupling between actuated and unactuated degrees of freedom.

                        explanation: "Underactuated systems have fewer control inputs than degrees of freedom, meaning they cannot accelerate in arbitrary directions in their configuration space. This fundamental limitation prevents them from following arbitrary reference trajectories."

                        explanation: "Exploiting natural dynamics means designing controllers that work with the system's inherent physics, using natural motions like swinging, ballistic trajectories, or passive stability. This approach often leads to more efficient, elegant motions compared to aggressive trajectory tracking."

The control law u = M(q)v + C(q,qÃá)qÃá + G(q) cancels nonlinearities, but parameter uncertainties can lead to poor performance or instability."

                        explanation: "Feedback linearization is highly sensitive to parameter uncertainties and modeling errors because it relies on exact cancellation of nonlinearities. Small errors in the model can lead to incomplete cancellation, resulting in poor performance or even instability."

                        explanation: "Energy-based control methods provide physical insight by working with fundamental quantities like kinetic and potential energy.

                        explanation: "Partial feedback linearization linearizes only the actuated subsystem dynamics while leaving unactuated dynamics in their original nonlinear form. This approach is used when full feedback linearization is impossible due to underactuation."

                        explanation: "Zero dynamics represent the internal system behavior when the system output is constrained to identically zero through feedback control. For underactuated systems, the zero dynamics describe how unactuated states evolve when actuated states follow prescribed trajectories."

                        explanation: "The spinning-up maneuver builds energy in the acrobot by rhythmically pumping the actuated elbow joint, similar to how a child pumps their legs on a swing. This energy buildup eventually allows the system to reach the upright configuration."

                        explanation: "Passivity-based control exploits natural energy-dissipation properties of mechanical systems to achieve stability. Passive systems naturally dissipate energy, providing inherent stability properties that can be leveraged in controller design."

                        explanation: "Virtual constraints are feedback-imposed relationships between system states that create effective constraints without physical enforcement. They allow coordination of multiple degrees of freedom and can transform underactuated systems into fully-actuated ones on invariant manifolds."

                        explanation: "Closed orbits in the pendulum phase portrait represent periodic oscillatory motion around the stable downward equilibrium. Each closed curve corresponds to a different energy level, with the pendulum swinging back and forth with that specific total energy."

                        explanation: "The homoclinic orbit is a trajectory that starts at the unstable upright equilibrium, makes a complete rotation, and returns to the same unstable equilibrium. It represents the separatrix between bounded oscillatory motion and unbounded rotational motion."

                        explanation: "Holonomic constraints reduce the number of degrees of freedom by imposing geometric relationships between coordinates.

                        explanation: "Euler's method assumes the slope f(xi) remains constant over the entire step interval h. This linear extrapolation introduces truncation error because the actual slope typically varies over the interval, making the method first-order accurate."

                        explanation: "Implicit methods have better stability because the unknown xi+1 appears on both sides of the equation, creating a relationship that naturally damps numerical instabilities.

                        explanation: "Newton's method is commonly used because it provides quadratic convergence near the solution. For the equation g(y) = 0, it uses yk+1 = yk - g(yk)/g'(yk), making it efficient for solving the nonlinear equations that arise in implicit methods."

                        explanation: "Stiff equations have solution components that evolve on vastly different time scales - some change rapidly while others change slowly. This forces explicit methods to use extremely small step sizes to maintain stability, even when the overall solution changes slowly."

                        explanation: "RK4 has local truncation error O(h‚Åµ), making it extremely accurate for reasonable step sizes. The global error is O(h‚Å¥), which is why it's called a fourth-order method. This high accuracy makes RK4 popular for general-purpose ODE solving."

                        explanation: "Adaptive step size control automatically adjusts h during integration based on local error estimates. It increases h where solutions are smooth (for efficiency) and decreases h where rapid changes occur (for accuracy), optimizing the accuracy-cost balance."

                        question: "What is trajectory planning in robotics?",
                        answer: "B",
                        explanation: "Trajectory planning determines the desired time evolution of position, velocity, and acceleration profiles that the robot should follow to move from start to goal configurations. It considers kinematic/dynamic constraints and optimization criteria."

                        question: "What is motion primitives in robotics?",
                        answer: "B",
                        explanation: "Motion primitives are elementary motion patterns or behaviors that can be combined to create complex motions. Examples include reaching, grasping, and walking steps. They provide building blocks for composing sophisticated robot behaviors."

                    {
                        question: "What is dynamic manipulation?",
                        answer: "B",
                        explanation: "Dynamic manipulation exploits the natural dynamics of both the robot and manipulated objects to achieve tasks that would be impossible with quasi-static approaches. Examples include juggling, throwing, and catching operations."

                    {
                        question: "What is the concept of virtual fixtures in robotics?",
                        answer: "B",
                        explanation: "Virtual fixtures provide guidance constraints that assist human operators or autonomous systems in performing tasks. They can enforce geometric constraints, forbidden regions, or preferred motion patterns, effectively creating virtual walls or guides in task space."

                        question: "What is shared control in robotics?",
                        answer: "B",
                        explanation: "Shared control involves human operators and autonomous systems sharing control authority. The robot provides assistance while the human retains high-level decision making. The allocation of control can be dynamic based on context and operator skill."

                        question: "What is teleoperation in robotics?",
                        answer: "B",
                        explanation: "Teleoperation enables human operators to control robots remotely, often with haptic feedback. It's essential for dangerous environments, space applications, and microsurgery where direct human presence is impossible or undesirable."
                    },
                    {
                        question: "What is haptic feedback in robotics?",
                        answer: "B",
                        explanation: "Haptic feedback provides force, tactile, or kinesthetic information to human operators during teleoperation or interaction. It enables operators to 'feel' what the robot is experiencing, improving manipulation performance and safety."

                    {
                        question: "What is swarm robotics?",
                        answer: "B",
                        explanation: "Swarm robotics studies coordination of multiple simple robots that work together to accomplish tasks beyond individual capabilities. Inspired by biological swarms, it emphasizes decentralized control, local communication, and emergent collective behaviors."

                        question: "What is the concept of manipulation primitives?",
                        answer: "B",
                        explanation: "Manipulation primitives are elementary manipulation actions like grasping, lifting, placing, and pushing that can be combined to create complex manipulation behaviors. They provide a modular approach to building sophisticated manipulation skills."
